## 1. Project ReadMe

All researchers are required to fill out a Project ReadMe. 
This file is central to the entire project and gets updated continuously during the research process. 
~This file should be in a plain text file format that can be version controlled on GitHub.~

* Here is a [template Project ReadMe file](https://github.com/livingingroups/ods_wiki/wiki/Project-ReadMe-template) created by Vlad, Roi, Brendan, and Tracy. 
* Here is a [checklist](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gktgpSEcRFaZqkQIjtechuP7vRVURgPE/view?usp=sharing) for the Project ReadMe created by Angie. 

#### Notes:

~Tracy is not sure how the project metadata file will fit into the Project ReadMe (or if we want to call it a Project ReadMe or a DMP), but I tried to include all the relevant information in the updated Project Readme template for easy extraction using exif or something like that.~ 

~If we move forward with the new draft Project ReadMe template, we only have partial examples.~ 

~* [Project metadata example](https://github.com/livingingroups/project_metadata/blob/main/project_metadata/metadata_template.txt) (by Brendan)~ 
* [Project summary / some data stuff example](https://github.com/livingingroups/project_metadata/blob/main/project_readme/README_examples_KStewart.md#readme-example-1) (by Kat) 

~Should we include these, make new examples, or not have any examples stored publicly?~

~Here are the old drafts of the various components that are now in the new draft Project ReadMe template:~

## 1. EoAS Supplies Inventory
### Requesting Equipment to Check out:

**To reserve supplies from the MPI-AB EAS Inventory**: Go to [MPIAB - EAS Inventory System](https://inventoryeas.ab.mpg.de/login) and login. Your username is the same as your MPIAB email (unless your email has more than 7 letters). If your email contains more than 7 letters, then your username will only be the first 7 letters of your MPIAB email. Your password is the same as your MPIAB email password.

### Purchsing New Equipment
**To request purchase of new supplies**: Follow the directions listed in the How To’s folder on [GWDG ownCloud](https://owncloud.gwdg.de/).

<!-- 
#### Notes:

One idea from Tracy for keeping track of hardware/software (see sections 9 and 10 of Brendan's OG [Project ReadMe](https://github.com/livingingroups/project_metadata/blob/main/project_readme/README.md)):

Prior to departure, work with Angie to create a .csv file of items purchased by MPI and taken to the field. 
Include as much information as possible for future study replication (e.g., manufacturer, model/version). 
As devices/supplies change over the years, their accuracy, sensitivity and other details may change in ways that impact inference. 

What do you think? I feel like there should be an easier way to do this, possibly interfacing with the inventory.

## 2. Ethics and permits

Consult with Angie and collaborators as to the permits required for your research. Start this process early!

Copies of all approved permits should be stored in your **server project folder**. 
Create a `ReadMe.txt` file that describes how to apply for these permits and store it in the same folder. 

If you are not required to get ethical permission to conduct research, select a set of ethical and animal welfare guidelines to follow. 
This [article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2019.11.002) details the guidelines laid about by the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour (ASAB) and Animal Behavior Society (ABS) and contains many current and relevant links in the “Obtaining further information” section and Appendix 1.

#### Notes:

Tracy added the ethical thing because it seems important even for projects like mine that don't require it. Feel free to delete it.

Here are the notes from earlier: 

Ask in questions/checklist? 
We could have a page with references and contacts for each country we work in, for example [STRI handles Panama Permits](https://stri.si.edu/plan-your-visit/scientific-research-permits) with MiAmbiente. 
Some info could be public, some could be private. This is dynamic and project specific.
This is Pending!?!

## 3. Field Logistics

### Logistics:

* Here is a [checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TrbRbwY5FD--9ArEJBNZqUHNbB2U1z72DNj_Zz3TPZ0/edit) for field work preparation created by Zea and Camila.
* Here is a [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Jwb8psWkpERE3ZPmf25zhDvYTPSPrni_p4rciBLT38w/edit) used to inform Angie of the logistics of your field work. 

## 4. Safety: 

All researchers are required to write a Risk Management Plan in collaboration with Angie prior to your departure to the field.
 
* Here is a *template for a Risk Management Plan* created by Angie. Modify and fill this out in collaboration with Angie before leaving for the field. (ANGIE TO ADD LINK LATER)
* Here is a *general field first aid kit supply list* generated by the EAS department at large. (TRACY TO ADD LINK LATER)
<!--
#### Notes:

Tracy added this section as an important part of field stuff. I'm not sure it belongs here - feel free to reject.

## 5. Collaborative agreements

* Here is a [template for an external collaborative agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rD0AtPObFftlLR7L-VItSNzZWf2COZtU/view?usp=sharing), to be filled out when funding is shared among institutions (required). Modify and fill out this form in collaboration with Angie before data collection begins.
* Here is a [template for a data sharing agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12LOACjax8YQbO4Yt1Z5TLD1cUNOvg3AO/view?usp=sharing), to be filled out when data is shared among institutions (required). Modify and fill out this form in collaboration with Angie before data collection begins. 
* Here is a [template for an internal collaborative agreement ](https://github.com/livingingroups/collaborative_agreement/blob/main/collab_agree.mdown) created by Alie and Vivek (optional).

<!--
#### Notes:

Tracy looked at those files and added a bit more description. Angie, please check I understand it correctly.
